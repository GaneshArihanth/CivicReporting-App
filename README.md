# Civic Mitra: Your Partner in Civic Reporting  

## Project Overview

**Civic Mitra** (meaning "Civic Friend" or "Partner") is a cross-platform mobile application designed to empower citizens by providing a simple, quick, and transparent way to report civic issues and maintenance problems in their locality. The goal is to bridge the gap between citizens and local government/civic bodies, promoting accountability and efficiency in resolving public concerns.

## Features

* **Geo-Location Tagging:** Automatically captures precise GPS coordinates for every reported incident, ensuring authorities know exactly where to dispatch resources.
* **Multimedia Uploads:** Allows users to submit photos and videos as evidence of the reported issue (e.g., potholes, broken streetlights, illegal dumping).
* **Issue Categorization:** Users can quickly classify issues using predefined categories (e.g., Road Safety, Sanitation, Public Utilities).
* **Status Tracking:** Provides real-time status updates on all submitted complaints (Reported, In Progress, Resolved).
* **User Feedback & Rating:** Allows citizens to rate the resolution quality provided by the civic authority.
* **Public Visibility Map:** (Future Feature) An optional feature to display anonymized reports on a public map to highlight problem areas and community engagement.
